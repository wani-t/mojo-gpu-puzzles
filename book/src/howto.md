## How to Use This Book

Each puzzle maintains a consistent structure to support systematic skill
development:

- **Overview**: Problem definition and key concepts for each challenge
- **Configuration**: Technical setup and memory organization details
- **Code to Complete**: Implementation framework in `problems/pXX/` with clearly
  marked sections to fill in
- **Tips**: Strategic hints available when needed, without revealing complete
  solutions
- **Solution**: Comprehensive implementation analysis, including performance
  considerations and conceptual explanations

The puzzles increase in complexity systematically, building new concepts on
established foundations. Working through them sequentially is recommended, as
advanced puzzles assume familiarity with concepts from earlier challenges.

## Running the code

All puzzles integrate with a testing framework that validates implementations
against expected results. Each puzzle provides specific execution instructions
and solution verification procedures.

## Prerequisites

### System requirements

Make sure your system meets our
[system requirements](https://docs.modular.com/packages#system-requirements).

### Compatible GPU

You'll need a
[compatible GPU](https://docs.modular.com/faq#gpu-requirements) to run the
puzzles. After setup, you can verify your GPU compatibility using the
`gpu-specs` command (see Quick Start section below).

## Operating System

> [!NOTE]
> Here is some documentation how to setup GPU support in your OS for
>
> - [Windows WSL2 for Linux with NVIDIA](#windows-wsl2-for-linux-with-nvidia)
> - [Linux native with NVIDIA](#linux-native-with-nvidia)
> - [macOS Apple Silicon](#macos-apple-silicon)

### Windows WSL2 for Linux with NVIDIA

To setup NVIVIA GPU support on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) e.g. Ubuntu
please follow the
[NVIDIA CUDA on WLS Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html).

The important information is to install the NVIDIA Windows CUDA Driver for
*Windows* because they fully support WSL2. Once a Windows NVIDIA GPU driver is
installed on the system, CUDA becomes available within WSL 2. The CUDA driver
installed on Windows host will be stubbed inside the WSL 2 as libcuda.so,
therefore users must not install any NVIDIA GPU Linux driver within WSL 2.

Once you have installed the drivers please test the installation

Verify from Windows: Open PowerShell (not WSL)

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Verify from inside WSL: (first start WLS e.g. via wsl -d Ubuntu)

```bash
ls -l /usr/lib/wsl/lib/nvidia-smi
/usr/lib/wsl/lib/nvidia-smi
```

Check setup from Pixi optionally install missing requirements e.g. for cuda-gdb
debugging

```bash
pixi run nvidia-smi
pixi run setup-cuda-gdb
pixi run mojo debug --help
pixi run cuda-gdb --version
```

For WSL you can install VSCode as your Editor

- Install VS Code on Windows from
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Then install the Remote - WSL extension.

> [!NOTE]
> All 35 puzzles work on WSL and Linux with a supported NVIDIA GPU. Some
> puzzles require a minimum compute capability, and the debugging and profiling
> puzzles require the corresponding NVIDIA tools. See the
> [GPU support matrix](#gpu-support-matrix).

### Linux native with NVIDIA

Check GPU + Ubuntu version (Supported Ubuntu LTS: 20.04, 22.04, 24.04)

```bash
lspci | grep -i nvidia
lsb_release -a
```

Install NVIDIA driver (mandatory)

```bash
sudo ubuntu-drivers devices
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
sudo reboot
```

For Linux you can install VSCode as your Editor

- Install VS Code in Linux via VS Code APT repository

Import Microsoft GPG key

```bash
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc \
  | gpg --dearmor \
  | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg > /dev/null
```

Add VS Code APT repository

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] \
https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list
```

Install VS Code and verify installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
code --version
```

> [!NOTE]
> All 35 puzzles work on Linux with a supported NVIDIA GPU. Some puzzles
> require a minimum compute capability; puzzle 34 needs SM90 (Hopper) or
> newer. See the [GPU support matrix](#gpu-support-matrix).

### macOS Apple Silicon

For `osx-arm64` users, you'll need:

- **macOS 15.0 or later** for optimal compatibility. Run `pixi run check-macos`
  and if it fails you'd need to upgrade.
- **Xcode 16 or later** (minimum required). Use `xcodebuild -version` to check.

If `xcrun -sdk macosx metal` outputs
`cannot execute tool 'metal' due to missing Metal toolchain` proceed by running

```bash
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

and then `xcrun -sdk macosx metal`, should give you the `no input files error`.

> [!NOTE]
> Puzzles 1-8, 11-19, 23-28, and 35 work on macOS (24 of the 35). The
> remainder need NVIDIA-specific tooling, hardware, or PyTorch GPU support.
> See the [GPU support matrix](#gpu-support-matrix). We're working to enable
> more. Please stay tuned!

## Programming knowledge

Basic knowledge of:

- Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Parallel computing concepts (threads, synchronization, race conditions)
- Basic familiarity with [Mojo](https://mojolang.org/docs/manual/) (language
  basics parts and
  [intro to pointers](https://mojolang.org/docs/manual/pointers/) section)
- [GPU programming fundamentals](https://docs.modular.com/gpu/fundamentals/)
  is helpful!

No prior GPU programming experience is necessary! We'll build that knowledge
through the puzzles.

Let's begin our journey into the exciting world of GPU computing with Mojo🔥!

## Setting up your environment

1. [Clone the GitHub repository](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles)
   and navigate to the repository:

    ```bash
    # Clone the stable branch, which matches this book
    git clone --branch stable https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles
    cd mojo-gpu-puzzles
    ```

    The `stable` branch is what
    [puzzles.modular.com](https://puzzles.modular.com) is built from, and it
    is pinned to the current MAX release. The repository's default branch,
    `main`, tracks nightly builds instead, so cloning it gives you puzzle code
    that may not compile against the release toolchain these instructions
    install. If you want to contribute a change, see
    [Development](#development).

2. Install a package manager to run the Mojo🔥 programs:

### **Option 1 (Highly recommended)**

   [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation)

   `pixi` is the **recommended option** for this project because:
   - Easy access to Modular's MAX/Mojo packages
   - Handles GPU dependencies
   - Full conda + PyPI ecosystem support

    > **Note: Some puzzles only work with `pixi`**

    **Install:**

     ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
     ```

    **Update:**

     ```bash
    pixi self-update
     ```

#### **Option 2**: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

> **Note**: This path is currently broken. The install fails because its
> dependencies pin Mojo below version 1.0, which no longer resolves against the
> release that the puzzles target. Use Option 1 (`pixi`) instead. The same
> problem affects every `uv run poe ...` command in this book.

    **Install:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    **Update:**

    ```bash
    uv self update
    ```

    **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Verify setup and run your first puzzle:**

<div class="code-tabs" data-tab-group="package-manager">
  <div class="tab-buttons">
    <button class="tab-button">pixi NVIDIA (default)</button>
    <button class="tab-button">pixi AMD</button>
    <button class="tab-button">pixi Apple</button>
    <button class="tab-button">uv</button>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
# Check your GPU specifications
pixi run gpu-specs

# Run your first puzzle
# This fails waiting for your implementation! follow the content
pixi run p01
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
# Check your GPU specifications
pixi run gpu-specs

# Run your first puzzle
# This fails waiting for your implementation! follow the content
pixi run -e amd p01
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
# Check your GPU specifications
pixi run gpu-specs

# Run your first puzzle
# This fails waiting for your implementation! follow the content
pixi run -e apple p01
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
# Install GPU-specific dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[nvidia]"  # For NVIDIA GPUs
# OR
uv pip install -e ".[amd]"     # For AMD GPUs

# Check your GPU specifications
uv run poe gpu-specs

# Run your first puzzle
# This fails waiting for your implementation! follow the content
uv run poe p01
```

  </div>
</div>

## Working with puzzles

### Project structure

- **[`problems/`](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles/tree/stable/problems)**:
  Where you implement your solutions (this is where you work!)
- **[`solutions/`](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles/tree/stable/solutions)**:
  Reference solutions for comparison and learning that we use throughout the
  book

These links point at the `stable` branch, matching the clone instructions
above. Browsing `main` instead shows nightly code that can differ from what
this book describes.

### Workflow

1. Navigate to `problems/pXX/` to find the puzzle template
2. Implement your solution in the provided framework
3. Test your implementation: `pixi run pXX` or `uv run poe pXX` (remember to
   include your platform with `-e platform` such as `-e amd`)
4. Compare with `solutions/pXX/` to learn different approaches

### Essential commands

> compatibility.

## GPU Resources

### Free cloud GPU platforms

If you don't have local GPU access, several cloud platforms offer free GPU
resources for learning and experimentation:

#### **Google Colab**

Google Colab provides free GPU access with some limitations for Mojo GPU
programming:

**Available GPUs:**

- Tesla T4 (older Turing architecture)
- Tesla V100 (limited availability)

**Limitations for Mojo GPU Puzzles:**

- **Older GPU architecture**: T4 GPUs may have limited compatibility with
  advanced Mojo GPU features
- **Session limits**: 12-hour maximum runtime, then automatic disconnect
- **Limited debugging support**: NVIDIA debugging tools (puzzles 9-10) may not
  be fully available
- **Package installation restrictions**: May require workarounds for Mojo/MAX
  installation
- **Performance limitations**: Shared infrastructure affects consistent
  benchmarking

**Recommended for:** Basic GPU programming concepts (puzzles 1-8, 11-15) and
learning fundamental patterns.

#### **Kaggle Notebooks**

Kaggle offers more generous free GPU access:

**Available GPUs:**

- Tesla T4 (30 hours per week free)
- P100 (limited availability)

**Advantages over Colab:**

- **More generous time limits**: 30 hours per week compared to Colab's daily
  session limits
- **Better persistence**: Notebooks save automatically
- **Consistent environment**: More reliable package installation

**Limitations for Mojo GPU Puzzles:**

- **Same GPU architecture constraints**: T4 compatibility issues with advanced
  features
- **Limited debugging tools**: NVIDIA profiling and debugging tools (puzzles
  9-10, 30-32) unavailable
- **Mojo installation complexity**: Requires manual setup of Mojo environment
- **Compute capability limits**: T4 is compute capability 7.5, so puzzles
  requiring 8.0 (16, 19, 22, 28, 29, 33) and 9.0 (34) won't run

**Recommended for:** Extended learning sessions on fundamental GPU programming
(puzzles 1-15).

### Recommendations

- **Complete Learning Path**: Use NVIDIA GPU for full curriculum access (all 35
  puzzles)
- **Comprehensive Learning**: AMD GPUs work well for most content (27 of 35
  puzzles)
- **Broad Coverage**: Apple GPUs cover fundamental through advanced concepts
  (24 of 35 puzzles)
- **Free Platform Learning**: Google Colab/Kaggle suitable for basic to
  intermediate concepts (puzzles 1-15; their T4 GPUs are below the compute
  capability 8.0 that puzzle 16 onward can require)
- **Debugging & Profiling**: NVIDIA GPU required for debugging tools and
  performance analysis
- **Modern GPU Features**: NVIDIA GPU required for Tensor Cores and cluster
  programming

## Development

This section is for contributing changes to the puzzles themselves, not for
solving them. Contributions target the `main` branch, which tracks nightly
builds, rather than the `stable` branch you cloned to work through the book.
For the build, test, and pull request workflow, see
[Development in the README](https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles#development).
