Welcome to our hands-on guide to GPU programming with
[Mojo](https://mojolang.org/docs/manual/) 🔥, the programming language that
combines Python syntax with systems-level performance, and the MAX accelerator
library, which provides most of the GPU APIs these puzzles use.

## Why GPU programming?

GPU programming has evolved from a specialized skill into fundamental
infrastructure for modern computing. From large language models processing
billions of parameters to computer vision systems analyzing real-time video
streams, GPU acceleration drives the computational breakthroughs we see today.
Scientific advances in climate modeling, drug discovery, and quantum simulation
depend on the massive parallel processing capabilities that GPUs uniquely
provide. Financial institutions rely on GPU computing for real-time risk
analysis and algorithmic trading, while autonomous vehicles process sensor data
through GPU-accelerated neural networks for critical decision-making.

The economic implications are substantial. Organizations that effectively
leverage GPU computing achieve significant competitive advantages: accelerated
development cycles, reduced computational costs, and the capacity to address
previously intractable computational challenges. In an era where computational
capability directly correlates with business value, GPU programming skills
represent a strategic differentiator for engineers, researchers, and
organizations.

## Why Mojo🔥 for GPU programming?

The computing industry has reached a critical point. CPU performance no longer
increases through higher clock speeds due to power and heat constraints.
Hardware manufacturers have shifted toward increasing physical cores. This
multi-core approach reaches its peak in modern GPUs, which contain thousands of
cores operating in parallel. The NVIDIA H100, for example, can run 16,896
threads simultaneously in a single clock cycle, with over 270,000 threads queued
for execution.

Mojo provides a practical approach to GPU programming, making this parallelism
more accessible:

- **Python-like Syntax** with systems programming capabilities
- **Zero-cost Abstractions** that compile to efficient machine code
- **Strong Type System** that catches errors at compile time
- **Built-in Tensor Support** with hardware-aware optimizations for GPU
  computation
- **Direct Access** to low-level CPU and GPU intrinsics
- **Cross-Hardware Portability** for code that runs on both CPUs and GPUs
- **Improved Safety** over traditional C/C++ GPU programming
- **Lower Barrier to Entry** for more programmers to access GPU power

> **Mojo🔥 aims to fuel innovation by democratizing GPU programming.** >**By
> expanding on Python's familiar syntax while adding direct GPU access, Mojo
> allows programmers with minimal specialized knowledge to build
> high-performance, heterogeneous (CPU, GPU-enabled) applications.**

## Why learn through puzzles?

Most GPU programming resources start with extensive theory before practical
implementation. This can overwhelm newcomers with abstract concepts that only
become clear through direct application.

This book uses a different approach: immediate engagement with practical
problems that progressively introduce concepts through guided discovery.

**Advantages of puzzle-based learning:**

- **Direct experience**: Immediate execution on GPU hardware provides concrete
  feedback
- **Incremental complexity**: Each challenge builds on previously established
  concepts
- **Applied focus**: Problems mirror real-world computational scenarios
- **Diagnostic skills**: Systematic debugging practice develops troubleshooting
  capabilities
- **Knowledge retention**: Active problem-solving reinforces understanding more
  effectively than passive consumption

The methodology emphasizes discovery over memorization. Concepts emerge
naturally through experimentation, creating deeper understanding and practical
competency.

## The GPU programming mindset

Effective GPU programming requires a fundamental shift in how we think about
computation. Here are some key mental models that will guide your journey:

### From sequential to parallel: Eliminating loops with threads

In traditional CPU programming, we process data sequentially through loops:

```python
# CPU approach
for i in range(data_size):
    result[i] = process(data[i])
```

GPU programming inverts this paradigm completely. Rather than iterating
sequentially through data, we assign thousands of parallel threads to process
data elements simultaneously:

```mojo
# GPU approach (conceptual)
thread_id = get_global_id()
if thread_id < data_size:
    result[thread_id] = process(data[thread_id])
```

Each thread handles a single data element, replacing explicit iteration with
massive parallelism. This fundamental reframing—from sequential processing to
concurrent execution across all data elements—represents the core conceptual
shift in GPU programming.

### Fitting a mesh of compute over data

Consider your data as a structured grid, with GPU threads forming a
corresponding computational grid that maps onto it. Effective GPU programming
involves designing this thread organization to optimally cover your data space:

- **Threads**: Individual processing units, each responsible for specific data
  elements
- **Blocks**: Coordinated thread groups with shared memory access and
  synchronization capabilities
- **Grid**: The complete thread hierarchy spanning the entire computational
  problem

Successful GPU programming requires balancing this thread organization to
maximize parallel efficiency while managing memory access patterns and
synchronization requirements.

### Data movement vs. computation

In GPU programming, data movement is often more expensive than computation:

- Moving data between CPU and GPU is slow
- Moving data between global and shared memory is faster
- Operating on data already in registers or shared memory is extremely fast

This inverts another common assumption in programming: computation is no longer
the bottleneck—data movement is.

Through the puzzles in this book, you'll develop an intuitive understanding of
these principles, transforming how you approach computational problems.

## What you will learn

This book takes you on a journey from first principles to advanced GPU
programming techniques. Rather than treating the GPU as a mysterious black box,
the content builds understanding layer by layer—starting with how individual
threads operate and culminating in sophisticated parallel algorithms. Learning
both low-level memory management and high-level tensor abstractions provides the
versatility to tackle any GPU programming challenge.
