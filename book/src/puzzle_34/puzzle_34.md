# Puzzle 34: GPU Cluster Programming (SM90+)

## Introduction

> **Hardware requirement: ⚠️ NVIDIA SM90+ Only**
>
> This puzzle requires **NVIDIA Hopper architecture** (H100, H200) or newer GPUs
> with SM90+ compute capability. The cluster programming APIs are
> hardware-accelerated and will raise errors on unsupported hardware. If you're
> unsure about the underlying architecture, run `pixi run gpu-specs` and must
> have at least `Compute Cap: 9.0` (see
> [GPU profiling basics](../puzzle_30/nvidia_profiling_basics.md) for hardware
> identification)

Building on your journey from
**[warp-level programming (Puzzles 24-26)](../puzzle_24/puzzle_24.md)** through
**[block-level programming (Puzzle 27)](../puzzle_27/puzzle_27.md)**, you'll now
learn **cluster-level programming** - coordinating multiple thread blocks to
solve problems that exceed single-block capabilities.

## What are thread block clusters?

Thread Block Clusters are a revolutionary SM90+ feature that enable
**multiple thread blocks to cooperate** on a single computational task with
hardware-accelerated synchronization and communication primitives.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Inter-block synchronization**: Coordinate multiple blocks with
  [`cluster_sync`](https://docs.modular.com/api/mojo/max/gpu/primitives/cluster/cluster_sync),
  [`cluster_arrive`](https://docs.modular.com/api/mojo/max/gpu/primitives/cluster/cluster_arrive),
  [`cluster_wait`](https://docs.modular.com/api/mojo/max/gpu/primitives/cluster/cluster_wait)
- **Block identification**: Use
  [`block_rank_in_cluster`](https://docs.modular.com/api/mojo/max/gpu/primitives/cluster/block_rank_in_cluster)
  for unique block coordination
- **Efficient coordination**:
  [`elect_one_sync`](https://docs.modular.com/api/mojo/max/gpu/primitives/cluster/elect_one_sync)
  for optimized warp-level cooperation
- **Advanced patterns**:
  [`cluster_mask_base`](https://docs.modular.com/api/mojo/max/gpu/primitives/cluster/cluster_mask_base)
  for selective block coordination

## The cluster programming model

### Traditional GPU programming hierarchy

```text
Grid (Multiple Blocks)
├── Block (Multiple Warps) - barrier() synchronization
    ├── Warp (32 Threads) - SIMT lockstep execution
    │   ├── Lane 0  ─┐
    │   ├── Lane 1   │ All execute same instruction
    │   ├── Lane 2   │ at same time (SIMT)
    │   │   ...      │ warp.sum(), warp.broadcast()
    │   └── Lane 31 ─┘
        └── Thread (SIMD operations within each thread)
```

### **New: Cluster programming hierarchy:**

```text
Grid (Multiple Clusters)
├── 🆕 Cluster (Multiple Blocks) - cluster_sync(), cluster_arrive()
    ├── Block (Multiple Warps) - barrier() synchronization
        ├── Warp (32 Threads) - SIMT lockstep execution
        │   ├── Lane 0  ─┐
        │   ├── Lane 1   │ All execute same instruction
        │   ├── Lane 2   │ at same time (SIMT)
        │   │   ...      │ warp.sum(), warp.broadcast()
        │   └── Lane 31 ─┘
            └── Thread (SIMD operations within each thread)
```

**Execution Model Details:**

- **Thread Level**: [SIMD operations](../puzzle_23/gpu-thread-vs-simd.md) within
  individual threads
- **Warp Level**: [SIMT execution](../puzzle_24/warp_simt.md) - 32 threads in
  lockstep coordination
- **Block Level**: [Multi-warp coordination](../puzzle_27/puzzle_27.md) with
  shared memory and barriers
- **🆕 Cluster Level**: Multi-block coordination with SM90+ cluster APIs

## Why cluster programming matters

**Problem Scale**: Modern AI and scientific workloads often require computations
that exceed single thread block capabilities:

- **Large matrix operations** requiring inter-block coordination (like
  [matrix multiplication from Puzzle 16](../puzzle_16/puzzle_16.md))
- **Multi-stage algorithms** with
  [producer-consumer dependencies from Puzzle 29](../puzzle_29/barrier.md)
- **Global statistics** across datasets larger than
  [shared memory from Puzzle 8](../puzzle_08/puzzle_08.md)
- **Advanced stencil computations** requiring neighbor block communication

**Hardware Evolution**: As GPUs gain more compute units (see
[GPU architecture profiling in Puzzle 30](../puzzle_30/nvidia_profiling_basics.md)),
**cluster programming becomes essential** for utilizing next-generation hardware
efficiently.
