## Overview

In signal processing and image analysis, convolution is a fundamental operation
that combines two sequences to produce a third sequence. This puzzle challenges
you to implement a 1D convolution on the GPU, where each output element is
computed by sliding a filter over an input array.

Implement a GPU kernel that computes a 1D convolution between input vector `a`
and filter vector `b`, storing the result in `output` using the `TileTensor`
abstraction.

**Note:** _You need to handle the general case. You only need 2 global reads and
1 global write per thread._

For those new to convolution, think of it as a weighted sliding window
operation. At each position, we multiply the filter values with the
corresponding input values and sum the results. In mathematical notation, this
is often written as:

\\[\Large output[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{\text{CONV}-1} a[i+j] \cdot b[j] \\]

In pseudocode, 1D convolution is:

```python
for i in range(SIZE):
    for j in range(CONV):
        if i + j < SIZE:
            ret[i] += a_host[i + j] * b_host[j]
```

This puzzle is split into two parts to help you build understanding
progressively:

- [Simple Version with Single Block](./simple.md) Start here to learn the basics
  of implementing convolution with shared memory in a single block using
  TileTensor.

- [Block Boundary Version](./block_boundary.md) Then tackle the more challenging
  case where data needs to be shared across block boundaries, leveraging
  TileTensor's capabilities.

Each version presents unique challenges in terms of memory access patterns and
thread coordination. The simple version helps you understand the basic
convolution operation, while the complete version tests your ability to handle
more complex scenarios that arise in real-world GPU programming.
