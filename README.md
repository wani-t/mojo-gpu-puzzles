## Overview

> _"For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
> them."_ — Aristotle, (Nicomachean Ethics)

Welcome to **Mojo🔥 GPU Puzzles, Edition 1** — an interactive approach to
learning GPU programming through hands-on puzzle solving. Instead of traditional
textbook learning, you'll immediately dive into writing real GPU code and seeing
the results.

## Why Mojo🔥

[Mojo](https://mojolang.org/docs/manual/) represents a revolutionary
approach to GPU programming, making massive parallelism accessible while
maintaining systems-level performance:

- 🐍 **Python-like Syntax** with systems programming capabilities
- ⚡ **Zero-cost Abstractions** that compile to efficient machine code
- 🛡️ **Strong Type System** catching errors at compile time
- 📊 **Built-in Tensor Support** with hardware-aware optimizations
- 🔧 **Direct Hardware Access** to CPU and GPU intrinsics
- 🔄 **Cross-Hardware Portability** for CPUs and GPUs
- 🎯 **Ergonomic Improvements** over traditional C/C++

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need a
[compatible GPU](https://docs.modular.com/faq#gpu-requirements) to run the
examples.

1. Visit [puzzles.modular.com](https://puzzles.modular.com)
2. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone --branch stable https://github.com/modular/mojo-gpu-puzzles
   cd mojo-gpu-puzzles
   ```

   The `stable` branch matches
   [puzzles.modular.com](https://puzzles.modular.com) and is pinned to the
   current MAX release. This repository's default branch, `main`, tracks
   nightly builds, so its puzzle code may not compile against the release
   toolchain. Clone `main` only if you intend to contribute a change (see
   [Development](#development)).

3. Install a package manager to run the Mojo🔥 programs:

### Option 1: [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation) (Highly recommended)

   `pixi` is the **recommended option** for this project because:

- Easy access to Modular's MAX/Mojo packages
- Handles GPU dependencies
- Full conda + PyPI ecosystem support

   **Note: A few puzzles only work with `pixi`.**

   **Install:**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
   ```

   **Update:**

   ```bash
   pixi self-update
   ```

### Option 2: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

> **Note**: This path is currently broken. The install fails because its
> dependencies pin Mojo below version 1.0, which no longer resolves against the
> release that the puzzles target. Use Option 1 (`pixi`) instead.

   **Install:**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   **Update:**

   ```bash
   uv self update
   ```

   **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Start solving puzzles!

## Development

We use `pixi` for development as it includes `uv` and also supports conda
packages (like `mdbook` from the `conda-forge` channel) needed for development
workflows.

> **WSL Users**: Before running `pixi run book`, install the required browser
> integration package:
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt update && sudo apt install wslu
> ```

> **Older NVIDIA driver workaround**: Mojo and MAX require NVIDIA driver ≥
> 580 (CUDA ≥ 13.0). Systems still on older drivers (for example, the Jetson
> Orin shipped with JetPack SDK on driver 540.x / CUDA 12.6) can hit a
> driver-version error at runtime. Point Mojo at the system `ptxas` to work
> around it:
>
> ```bash
> export MODULAR_NVPTX_COMPILER_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/ptxas
> ```
>
> The exact path can vary — see the
> [system requirements](https://mojolang.org/docs/requirements/#nvidia-gpus)
> for the canonical CUDA toolchain locations on each platform. Add the export
> to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent shell rc) to make it persistent.

```bash
# Build and serve the book
pixi run book

# Test solutions on GPU
pixi run tests
# Or a specific puzzle
pixi run tests pXX
# Or manually
pixi run mojo/python solutions/pXX/pXX.{mojo,py}

# Run GPU sanitizers for debugging on NVIDIA GPUs using `compute-sanitizer`
pixi run memcheck  <optional pXX>    # Detect memory errors
pixi run racecheck <optional pXX>    # Detect race conditions
pixi run synccheck <optional pXX>    # Detect synchronization errors
pixi run initcheck <optional pXX>    # Detect uninitialized memory access
# Or run all sanitizer tools
pixi run sanitizers pXX
# Or manually
# Note: ignore the mojo runtime error collision with the sanitizer. Look for `Error SUMMARY`
pixi run compute-sanitizer --tool {memcheck,racecheck,synccheck,initcheck} mojo solutions/pXX/pXX.mojo

# Format code
pixi run format
```

### Keeping problems and solutions in sync

Each `problems/pNN/` file is the same as its `solutions/pNN/` counterpart
**except** that the student fill-in regions are blanked out with `# FILL ME IN`
hints (and an optional `...` placeholder so an empty body still compiles), and
the `# ANCHOR:` markers drop the `_solution` suffix the solution uses. Solving a
puzzle should therefore only ever *add* lines.

When you change a solution (for example, migrating to a new API), update the
matching problem skeleton the same way. Two checks guard this (both run in CI):

```bash
pixi run check-skeletons    # problem == solution outside the fill-in regions
pixi run compile-problems   # every unfilled skeleton still compiles
```

(`problems/p10` is intentionally exempt — it is the sanitizer puzzle, whose
skeleton ships deliberately buggy kernels for you to catch with `memcheck` /
`racecheck`.)
