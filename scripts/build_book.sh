# Build English + all translated mdbook languages.
# Auto-discovers languages from book/i18n/*/book.toml
#
# Fonts + lottie-player are fetched from CDN and fall back to a locally
# vendored copy at runtime if that fails (see book/theme/head.hbs and
# book/theme/index.hbs) — this script never needs network access itself.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/build_book.sh                     # CI: translations → html/{lang}/
#   bash scripts/build_book.sh --serve              # Dev: translations → html-{lang}/
#   bash scripts/build_book.sh --offline            # also pre-fetch the runtime
#                                                     # fallback assets, so the book
#                                                     # is ready to browse with no
#                                                     # network access right away
